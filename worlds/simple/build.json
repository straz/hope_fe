      "text": "# In A New York Minute\n\n### Chapter 1\n\nCarl wasn't like other designers, like interior decorators or\nlandscapers.  They can create spaces, but they can't create space. An\nacre of land is just an acre of land. There's no steam shovel that can\nturn one acre into two. Space can be marked up and decorated, but it\ncan't be created.\n\nFor a designer, it came down to choices. You can have the walnut\nboudoir or maybe the stainless Parsons table.  You pick the one that\nfeels right, that creates the mood, that works efficiently, that\ncreates the space.\n\nCarl didn't work with space, he worked with time. He designed\ntimelines. Some timelines were drab, unremarkable. People want their\ntime to feel well-spent. They can't have any more of it, but they do\nwant more from the time they have.\n\n\"More\" without getting any more, that's what they get from a good\ntimeline designer. The first meeting is where they lay out their\nexpectations. They've heard stories, they bring their own dreams, they\nsee how others look back on what they have done. A client's time is\nprecious to them, and they wanted it arranged as well as it could be.\n\nBusiness was good. Some clients were difficult but Carl always did his\nbest, even if he felt annoyed. He had learned that his first\nimpression wasn't always accurate, that he should be patient and wait\nto see if the client was really going to be implacable. \n\nSpace is subjective, but time is relative. A day lasts for a day, no\nmatter how it feels. \n\n\n\n![watch](https://straz.github.io/hope_fe/pix/watchww.png)",

He was feeling a bit tired,\nthere were too many things on his mind, and he just wanted to\nget this over with.\n\nThere was a crowd of kids, probably some kind of high school\nvolleyball team, standing in front of the elevator.  They had just\narrived with their luggage. The kids laughed and elbowed each other\nabout some joke they shared.\n\nIt might be easier, Carl thought to himself, to avoid the elevator for\nnow.  Scanning the lobby, he saw what looked like a sign pointing to\nthe stairs opposite the front desk, behind a large philodendron. It\nwas only two flights up.\n\n{{ place }}\n\nHe made it to the room in no time at all, and let himself in with the\nkey in his shirt pocket.",
